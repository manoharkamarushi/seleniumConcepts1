Running as a grid node:
-------------------------------

Usage: java -jar selenium-server.jar -role node [options]

  -host:
    <IP | hostname> : usually not needed and determined
      automatically. For exotic network configuration, network with
      VPN, specifying the host might be necessary.

  -port:
    <xxxx> : the port the remote/hub will listen on. Default to 4444.

  -cleanupCycle:
    <XXXX> in ms. How often a proxy will check for timed out thread.

  -timeout:
    <XXXX>  the timeout in seconds before the hub automatically ends
      a test that hasn't had any activity in the last X seconds. The
      browser will be released for another test to use. This typically
      takes care of the client crashes.

  -browserTimeout:
    The timeout in seconds a browser can hang

  -hub:
    <http://localhost:4444/grid/register> : the url that will be used
      to post the registration request. This option takes precedence
      over -hubHost and -hubPort options.

  -hubHost:
    <IP | hostname> : the host address of a hub the registration
      request should be sent to. Default to localhost. Option -hub
      takes precedence over this option.

  -hubPort:
    <xxxx> : the port listened by a hub the registration request
      should be sent to. Default to 4444. Option -hub takes precedence
      over this option.

  -proxy:
    the class that will be used to represent the node. By default
      org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.DefaultRemoteProxy.

  -maxSession:
    max number of tests that can run at the same time on the node,
      independently of the browser used.

  -registerCycle:
    how often in ms the node will try to register itself again.Allow
      to restart the hub without having to restart the nodes.

  -nodePolling:
    in ms. Interval between alive checks of node how often the hub
      checks if the node is still alive.

  -unregisterIfStillDownAfter:
    in ms. If the node remains down for more than
      unregisterIfStillDownAfter millisec, it will disappear from the
      hub.Default is 1min.

  -downPollingLimit:
    node is marked as down after downPollingLimit alive checks.

  -nodeStatusCheckTimeout:
    in ms. Connection and socket timeout which is used for node alive
      check.
